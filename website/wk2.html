<div class="explain">
  <p>For the first step of the process, i wanted to create a visual of the expected final outcome.
  In the lobby of the VR headset, i wanted to introduce each chatcter. Every character has a differnt story and differnet love approches.
The stories are not conncected, that way wer are able to display mulitple sceniros of "love".Through research and public interviews, i will collect information to form the stories and devolp the relationships of the characters.
The charcaters also provide various points of views for the toxic love. <br>
Currently I am not planning on adding player choice. Meaning i want to limit the amount of agency the audenice has, that way i can really emphasize the heaviness of the story and lack of control that indiviuals usally have in toxic relationshipd.
It also adds to the emotion of regret, because regret comes with hindsight and wishing you are able to change what happens. By giving the audenice control, they might alter the emotions i wish to convey.
